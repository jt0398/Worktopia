## Overview
Co-working is the next big thing!!! WorkTopia aims at disrupting the real estate industry and establish a new business mode - **Real-estate As A Service (RaaS)**.

## What does WorkTopia do for you?
WorkTopia offers a platform for letting out workspaces on completely your terms.
- Part of the floor? - Sure, why not?
- Couple of days a week? - Ofcourse...
- Unfurnished, long term? - We hear you!
and the options are endless!!!

And don't jump to conclusions, the same flexibility is available for potential leasees as well!
 - Want to brew some coffee while at work? - No one can say no to that
 - Amphitheatre? - We got that one too
 - 3D printing? - Point taken

In essence, WorkTopia aims to solve the perennial problem of supply and demand in the workspace domain.
Leave the hassles of fineprints and legal contracts to the experts while you enjoy a productive workday!!

### Market Study

Co-working is a trend that is ready to explode, and gone are the days where it was [associated just to start ups](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/01/coworking-spaces-arent-just-for-entrepreneurs-anymore.html).

Toronto is ranked Third, behind London and New York in the rate of new shared office openings, according to [research](https://www.coworkingresources.org/blog/key-figures-coworking-growth) by CoworkingResources. A new space opens every 13 days in Toronto, compared with every five days in London and 7.5 days in New York, the report says.

However the gap in demand - supply is ever widening in most Tier 1 cities globally, and Toronto is no exception.

Quite evident from the research is that "owning" large spaces is history! Rising costs, reduced availability and time of construction are all factors that force companies to look for alternatives.
And this includes large corporations and enterprises as well.

### Target Customers

1. Free lancers, Contractors and Consultants who are looking for priviate spaces
2. Start up companies
3. Enterprises looking to expand operations
4. Event Planners
